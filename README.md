# Dotfiles

A collection of dotfiles that I use :3

---

## Placing dotfiles in the right place

1. Install `stow`
2. Execute `stow {package-name}`

---

## Alacritty

Mostly configured for Arch Linux (abandoned for now)

---

## Neovim

Mostly configured for WSL (Ubuntu) and the Windows Terminal.

**Dependencies:**

1. `zip` and `unzip` (for `stylua`)
2. `ripgrep` (for `telescope`)
